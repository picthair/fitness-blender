<p>As i’ve mentioned before what’s amazing about this workout is that it consists of 12 rounds that last 3 minutes and alternate between high intensity cardio and resistance moves. I�m on week 3 now trying todo 4 workouts a week, iv took photos from week one, so next week i am going to take more photos as it�s week 4 to see. Try to have no more than one big night out a week, and aim to do an extra bit of exercise on the day you�re going out to compensate. Charlotte and richard use weighted gloves, (i purchased some from tk maxx to intensify my workout) which you don’t have to use but can do for added resistance to your workout.the warm up is easy peasy and will wake up your muscles ready for round 1.
