<p>This is a 48 minute intermediate step &amp; muscle workout you can do at home. Sit on floor in pike with feet pointed, hold for 10 seconds, flex feet hold for 10 seconds. Learning how to do gymnastics at home requires learning the steps leading up to the moves (see here for the five gymnastics exercises everyone should do before beginning a gymnastics workout routine). If the beginner floor workout plan seems way too easy for you, and you routinely practice much more advanced skills at the gym, then maybe the intermediate workout plan is right for you. 30 minutes to 1 hour per workout is plenty of time for your gymnast to get in a good overall workout.</p>
