<p><strong>Swimming Glute Workout</strong>, Using your arms ensures you have a balanced workout divided up. Movement through water, whether swimming, kicking, jogging or treading, presents your muscles with resistance, which helps to strengthen them. Swimming is a full body workout that uses almost every muscle group, including the three muscles that make up the butt: If you keep up the intensity, 30 minutes of swimming laps five days a week can achieve results that take longer on other cardio equipment as it works multiple muscle groups and gets the heart pumping quickly.</p>
