Each 20min workout mixes up 1 to 3 different exercises followed by 1 to 2 min of cardio, which repeats (with different exercises, you only do the same exercise for 1min once, which keeps the whole program fresh imo) about four times (one new set per trainer). Because there�s little rest between moves, the whole workout seems to fly by, but there�s no denying its overall intensity. 1/ST CONTENT APPOINTS GREGG COLVIN AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE.</p>
