<p>Tingling/numbness in the face, lips, or extremities ‚Äúwhen you do a dry pre workout scoop for the first time knowing you don‚Äôt consume caffeine regularly and end up in the hospital for a heart attack,‚Äù portillo wrote. ItÔøΩs much more dangerous to be sitting on a couch doing nothing than exercising at a suitable level. Both days after my chest is tight and my left arm feels a little numb nothing crazy tho. Can exercise cause a heart attack?.</p>
