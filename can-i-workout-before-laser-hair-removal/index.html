<p>Don’t use bleaching creams or perfume products for 24 to 48 hours. Don’t do any activities prior to coming in for treatment that will make you hot and sweaty. It’s the root of the hair the laser targets, so the root must be present for your treatment to work best. To be safe you need 2 days wait before you can go and workout.
