<p><strong>Bpi Pre Workout Caffeine</strong>, The fda recommends no more than 400mg of caffeine per day, so any pre workout powder that has less caffeine than this is generally considered to be safe. With a unique combination of potent ingredients including beetroot, carnitine, and citrulline, one more rep™ delivers the strength and stamina you need to work out harder, for longer. If you’re not really sensitive to caffeine, you should be safe from side effects like jitters and energy crashes. You may want to consider using the supplement if you want to bulk up and have a toned stomach.</p>
