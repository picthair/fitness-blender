<p>Additionally, a feedback mechanism that allows for varying resistance to the forward movement, based on power, weight and angle of climb needs to be configured. Incline also adds practical benefits to elliptical workouts: You can use google maps to plot routes that you take when you are walking, running or cycling. Natascha martens, strategic partner manager for google maps™ platform, contributed an article to the google blog, and mentioned ifit’s technology on nordictrack.</p>
