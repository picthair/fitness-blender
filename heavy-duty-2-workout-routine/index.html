<p><strong>Heavy Duty 2 Workout Routine</strong>, The second workout was back, shoulders and biceps. When you reach 12 reps with that weight, add about 20% to. The rep protocol should be the same on all exercises: My consolidation routine (listed in my book heavy duty ii) is especially effective for powerlifters, as it includes squats, deadlifts and dips.</p>

Heavy Hitter Workout From darebee.com</p>
<p>Once you get adjusted with the weight you’re lifting, try to increase it within this rep range. Training should be simple, you don’t need pre exhaustion,crazy intensity, drop sets, negative reps, rest pause, forced reps. Dips are particularly effective as an adjunct to bench presses and should be used alternately with that exercise in my consolidation program. Since these are just 3 workouts you need to do during the week, you can rest one day in between each workout and take the weekend off if you wanted to.</p>
