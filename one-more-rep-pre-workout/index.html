<p>1 g beta alanine, 2g citrulline malate, 200mg caffeine helps you keep the focus while enhancing energy upon hitting that extra set or rep you always wanted. Compared to the regular version of one more rep that’s now out on the market, the upcoming one more rep complete has over twice the amount of active ingredients in terms of weight. The focus you get is unreal and it really does make me one to push one more rep out as cliché as it sounds. Seriously my top favorite for a none stim pre workout.
