<p>Friday is the day when i like to focus on my cardio and give a little extra time to that part of my workout. The core muscles in the abdomen, pelvis and lower back connect the lower and upper body and help protect the back. You can start this program doing 5x5, but you will need to switch to 3x5 soon enough as 5x5 is going to become too much. Wednesday on wednesday, perform the same exercises you did on monday to work your leg muscles, but instead of doing cardiovascular exercise, complete abdominal exercises after your leg workout. Currently my focus is on weight lifting since i want to add some muscles.</p>
