<p>Join the conversation on twitter/instagram:@jockowillink @echocharles excerpt from jockopodcast 12 He surfs after his workout after his workout, he goes to the san diego beach for a quick surf. I’m going to pull on one day, i’m going to push on another day, i’m going to lift on the next day, and i’m going to squat on the final day the fourth day. He sets multiple alarms every night, but rarely uses them unless he�s recovering from a heavy workout or event. Jocko Willink Workout Routine And Diet Plan Train Like A.</p>
