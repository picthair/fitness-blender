<p><strong>Iron Addict Workout Routine</strong>, Before having a crack at these nine killer sessions, you should have been working towards your ironman goal for a couple of months and built up your swim, bike and run volume. Exercises to build your body and strength entail workout routines that focus on chest and arm exercises. Each of these prison workouts should take 30 minutes or less. Some people have told me they use the big compound exercises, but on investigation i discovered that more than half of the exercises they use are isolation movements.</p>
