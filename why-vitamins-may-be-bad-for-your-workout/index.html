Vitamins a, d, e and k are fat soluble, which means they are stored in the body and if taken in high doses can be toxic. Studies suggest that the use of large doses of antioxidant supplements, especially vitamins c and e, may actually reduce rather than promote some of the beneficial effects of exercise. For each vitamin, function related to physical activity, requirement, and status measures are given.</p>
