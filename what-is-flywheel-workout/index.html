<p><strong>What Is Flywheel Workout</strong>, This is because the main function of a flywheel is to generate resistance while pedaling so that you can have a more challenging workout and burn more calories in the process. The inertia resulting from the size and number of flywheels impacts the training adaptation you get. It connects to the pedals via a chain or a belt and stores the rotational energy generated during a workout. The momentum builds and the flywheel supplies a smooth and steady cycling action.</p>
