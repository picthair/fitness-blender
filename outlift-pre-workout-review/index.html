<p>There are about 200 outlift pre workout reviews on amazon, which is a pretty solid sample size for us to draw information from. It received an average rating of 4.7 out of 5, which is pretty impressive. This is down to the fact that it contains clinical doses of its active ingredients. I liked the effects from the citrulline, normally in many pre workout supplements citrulline is far too under dosed to offer any benefit to your workout.
