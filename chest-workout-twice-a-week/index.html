<p>Small muscles (like biceps, triceps, forearms, and calves) can be trained twice a week because they don�t take as long to recover. Rest for the rest of the week. If you choose this type of routine, it would be best to divide your chest workouts into two sessions per week. I�m currently dieting and on clomid right now, and going to be starting my cycle in march sometime. How many times per week should I do HIIT workout? Quora.</p>
