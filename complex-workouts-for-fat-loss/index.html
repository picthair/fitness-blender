<p><strong>Complex Workouts For Fat Loss</strong>, Some important things to remember: I find full body complex bouts are the best for fat loss, alternating the exercises between upper body and lower body (e.g., overhead presses followed by front squats), and/or using hybrid compound lifts (e.g., thrusters, overhead squats, etc). In some cases, this effect can even last for hours at a time. They’re exercises with which you perform a couple of movements consecutively without placing the bar down.</p>
