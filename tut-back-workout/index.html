<p><strong>Tut Back Workout</strong>, This means you are supposed to lower the weight in four seconds, pause for one second, lift in two seconds, and pause for one second, giving you a tut of eight seconds per rep. For example, you might see something like 4:1:2:1. Your thighs will feel like they’re burning because there is no brief respite for the muscles. All one needs to do is sit in the gym and realize most, including myself at times, are training in the strength/power range.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://picthair.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://laurengleisberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ExerciseSummary_8-8-1024x999.jpg" alt="QUICK &#43; EFFECTIVE AB WORKOUT Lauren Gleisberg" title="QUICK &#43; EFFECTIVE AB WORKOUT Lauren Gleisberg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/picthair.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

<p>During tut workouts, you lengthen each phase of the movement to make your sets longer. It rides on the theory that the more stress, or tension, that’s placed on the muscle, the more breakdown will occur, leading to gains. To manipulate the tut, all parts of the given rep are given a time. Tut is simply a training method that involves counting exercise time, not reps.</p>

<p>However, saying that tut is “important” doesn’t mean anything, because your muscles are under tension for a given amount of time during any type of resistance exercise. So, if you bench 200 lbs., aim for 100, while shooting for eight to 10 seconds down to your chest and another eight to 10 seconds while lifting the bar back up. And changing the speed at which you perform each repetition is far from being the only way to alter tut. For example, if you did the barbell curl and it took you two seconds to curl the weight up and another two seconds to lower it, that’s four seconds of tension per rep. Start with the top of the dumbbell press.</p>
