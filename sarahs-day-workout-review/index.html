<p>Her online core and pelvic floor programs have helped thousands of women recover from pelvic floor issues, diastasis recti, si joint dysfunction and more. I haven’t been this sore since my first go at the original p90x back in 2008. Thirty seconds of triceps dips on a chair (the seventh exercise out of 12) would have been more aptly named triceps dips to exhaustion, and i think i just barely cranked out six reps of move number 11,. Her workouts are hard af, but so worth it and the results can be seen in not only your body but in how many more reps you can do is amazing. While i absolutely loved those and won�t say i�ll never do them again, i found something to be so different about sarah�s workout that made me never want to skip a day of her program.</p>
