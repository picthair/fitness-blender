<p><strong>Leg Curls Bicep Workout</strong>, This exercise is going to blow up your biceps. The regular body drag curl was a favorite of the late, great vince gironda for targeting the biceps. Raise your butt off the floor until your body forms a straight line. To perform the concentration curl, sit on a bench and rest whichever arm you choose on the leg of the same side and let the weight hang down naturally.</p>

<p>To perform the concentration curl, sit on a bench and rest whichever arm you choose on the leg of the same side and let the weight hang down naturally. Lift your leg towards your torso focusing on the contraction in your bicep. I see many women doing a lot of curls quickly then moving on to other exercises. Sometimes we just don’t have access to equipment but that’s not an issue with the bicep leg curl as you only need your arms and legs (you’ve probably guessed them by now) to get an effective workout.</p>

<p>Lift your leg towards your torso focusing on the contraction in your bicep. To perform the concentration curl, sit on a bench and rest whichever arm you choose on the leg of the same side and let the weight hang down naturally. A lot of women struggle to get definition in their arms because they don�t exercise their biceps. The regular body drag curl was a favorite of the late, great vince gironda for targeting the biceps. This variation focuses on the eccentric phase of that powerful movement, using more weight than you normally could for it.</p>
