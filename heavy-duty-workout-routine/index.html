<p><strong>Heavy Duty Workout Routine</strong>, Day 17 repeat cycle, beginning with day 1, chest and back. An example rest pause workout that mike would do for his chest was pec deck 1 set of 4 rest pause reps, incline bench press 1 set of 4 rest pause reps and dips (negative only style) 1 set of 5 reps. Mike then had to ask himself what could be more intense then rest pause training? Form is everything when using a heavy load but if you reach 6 reps and you have a training partner you need to.</p>
