<p>I�ve been not only following the plan to a t. I have officially completed phase 1 of the jamie eason live fit trainer yesterday. The workouts are pretty basic, and definitely an honest amount of work, but nothing that is too taxing on the body. Day 1 chest and triceps what’s your goal? Phase 3 Day 57 Jamie eason, Jamie eason live fit, 12.</p>

<p>In phase 3 of jamie eason�s livefit trainer, you�ll combine resistance exercise and cardio work for maximum results. Many people have complained that they didn’t like this phase because there is no cardio. Measure and weigh everything whenever possible. The third phase focuses on building muscle and continued clean eating. Jamie eason, Trainers and Chang�e 3 on Pinterest.</p>
