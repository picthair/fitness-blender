<p><strong>Apple Watch Not Counting Workout As Exercise</strong>, When you start an other workout, the apple watch counts exercise minutes regardless of how much movement it. However, during workouts, consider tightening it more than usual, and after finishing, ease it back to a comfy fit. If you turn off heart rate in privacy settings, you also won�t get a heart rate measurement. I usually do a daily burn app workout in the morning, then some number of minutes on a stationary bike needed to get 30 minutes of exercise at least.</p>

<p>Last night, i went for a 30 minute walk (solo, no kids), used the “outdoor walk” workout to record it, and i was credited with 30 minutes on my activity ring. If you have apple watch series 1 or earlier, bring your iphone for gps. There’s a flaw in my data collection methodology and it’s that the activity app records all minutes of exercise, not just those with workouts, so in some cases (especially at home), the app shows more than 100% credit because presumably i ran up and down the stairs doing chores or something and that’s not shown as workout data but does show as total. Not the same old issue of the watch only counting activity if your heart rate gets to a certain point, or if you reach a certain pace with running/walking.
