<p><strong>Not Being Able To Straighten Arm After Workout</strong>, I can�t extend my arm after bicep/tricep workout. The pain in my arm has been getting progressively worse, and also shoots into my right upper arm on the outside when i straighten the arm. However, if you literally can’t straighten your arm a few days after a round of bicep curls, it’s probably time to call the doctor. I felt this immediately after working out, and it�s only gotten worse.</p>

<p>Make sure that your shoulder does not lift off the floor as you lie in this position. Opening a jar is fine, carrying things is fine, etc. Right arm can be extended 160 degree but the left arm couldnt be straightened more than 90 degree. Stand straight on the ground with your feet close to each other and arms relaxed.</p>

<p>This needs to be resolved by a medical professional. Slowly progress your workouts so your muscles are able to adapt, recover and grow back stronger between each lifting session. After maybe 5 or so sessions i was able to touch my shoulder and reach behind my neck to put on a necklace. Best thing i can suggest when people get back into lifting is to work on muscular endurance for a couple weeks before anything else. So it’s not a quick process.</p>
