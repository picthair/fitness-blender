<p>While some waist trainer proponents might suggest that you wear your trainer while you exercise, it’s not a good idea. Waist training while working out is one of the most effective ways of getting into shape and strengthening your core. Wearing a waist trainer for at least 8 hours a day or during workout is known as waist training. ‘i’ve noticed that when i take the waist trainer off at the end of the day, the ‘hour glass’ effect remains.’ this, of course, is a very good point for waist trainers all around!
