<p>Ben tells us, “it is absolutely possible to build a shape like this by just using bodyweight exercises and calisthenics (bodyweight exercises with the aid of bars, rings and jump ropes) as both. On top of that, he also does cardio workouts that help him maintain his speed in spite of his bulk. He was a skinny defender during his days at sevilla but is now completely ripped. Being strong in the upper body is a well ignored advantage, but the likes of george elokobi and an american player whos name i forget show that it can be a huge advantage (elokobi is an absolute beast in defence). Wolves Elokobi faces uncertain future Birmingham.</p>
