<p>With less caffeine, psychotic black is ideal for those who need that extra push but want a lower stim pre. 1 the maximum amount of caffeine recommended for consumption is 400mg per day. If you’re sensitive to stimulants i highly suggest starting off with just half a scoop. Since psychotic is considered to be quite a high stimulant pre workout, some users could experience side effects if they aren’t used to taking stimulants.
