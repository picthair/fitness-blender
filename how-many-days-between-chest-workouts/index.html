Day 1 (7 total sets) pause bench press (4 sets)</p>

<p>The standard advice these days is that you should give yourself at least 48 hours in between full body workouts. I like to have at least 3 days between back and chest workouts, and two days between everything else.

I usually have at least 2 days between chest and shoulder workouts. (begin with workouts 1 + 2;</p>
