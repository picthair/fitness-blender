<p>When you’re a new dad, it becomes hard to fit in a good workout.but you’d be surprised as to how many exercises you can perform using only your kiddo (and a car seat). What’s more, when you use your tot as a piece of exercise equipment, you get a workout, while your little champ gets all the benefits that come with roughhousing. Moms can take yoga, toning, water aerobics or pilates classes during pregnancy. It’s a great way to kick start your postpartum body into feeling more active and strong.
