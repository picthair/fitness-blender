<p>I’ve created 2 complete total body workouts that utilize each of these movement patterns. This advanced athlete program takes all of the key attributes of a successful sportsperson and ramps up the workload to get you faster, stronger and more powerful. If you’re a beginner, give workout a a try. Then you’ll move into a circuit workout. Pin on Sports.</p>
