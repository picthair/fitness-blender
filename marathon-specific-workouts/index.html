<p><strong>Marathon Specific Workouts</strong>, These are just challenges you can complete in training and are excellent fitness boosters leading into a race, as they are very specific to the event of the half marathon. While hard long runs are certainly an important part of marathon training, my favorite workout is the 2 x 6 mile, which was made famous by runners at the hansons olympic. All of these workouts (or very similar alternatives) have been used by professional runners leading into major half marathon races. Another bread and butter session for me, with 10 miles in the legs already, you have to muster up some marathon pace for another 10 miles, i�ll aim to do this session in a park or an uninterrupted loop so i can really dial in the pace and know how.</p>
