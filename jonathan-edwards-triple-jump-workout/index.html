<p>Components of the triple jump first phase “contrary to popular belief, the leg is planted in front of the body at touchdown. This event is one that demands strength, power, and explosiveness to become an elite performer. The world record holder and olympic champion was literally as light as a feather (he weighed in at his peak at 65kg), yet was incredibly powerful. Television (tv) presenters commented that jonathan edwards’ leg landed directly under his body, but this was an inaccurate observation due to tv footage being reviewed at 25 frames per second (fps).

<p>Here are a few videos that you can use as a visual reference for the type of triple jump technique that you want to execute. When jonathan edwards set the current men’s world record of 18.29 metres in 1995, he attributed his enormous 85 centimetre improvement from the previous year to the adoption of a “double arm shift” technique. Ukraine�s inessa kravets is the current. Even if you never intend to beat jonathan edwards’s unassailable triple jump world record, this is a great exercise for building power in both.
