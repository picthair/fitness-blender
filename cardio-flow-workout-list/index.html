<p><strong>Cardio Flow Workout List</strong>, Lower into a right side lunge, left arm reaching across to right foot, right arm extended back—with both arms ready to generate rotational power [as shown]. If you want to incorporate more cardio exercise into your day, consider taking up running, swimming, kickboxing, skipping rope, and skiing. Aerobic exercise, also known as “cardio” exercise, uses repetitive contraction of large muscle groups to get your heart beating faster and is the most beneficial type of exercise for your cardiovascular system (your heart and blood vessels).
