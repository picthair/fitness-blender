<p>When you finish your day at the hot beach, your bikram yoga class, your run at the local park, or finishing that last rep at the gym on leg day, you rarely have time to take a shower before moving onto the rest of your busy schedule. Just zip up the removable hoodie and slip over your headrest for a secure mount to your seat post workout. Cooling towels can be worn before, during, and after a workout, with most designs offering at least two hours of cooling. Raise the towel into an overhead position and bend your arms to allow the towel to go behind your head and pull down to your back. The Best Cooling Towel Options for PostWorkout Bob Vila.</p>
