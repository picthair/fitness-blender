<p>Month 2 workouts seemed more resistance oriented than the month 1 workouts. Again, i was pushing myself to the limit each and every time. For that i had to prep 1 month of yoga, 3 weeks of original insanity and in spite of that day 1 of max 30 felt like i was back to day 1 in my first ever insanity workout (i had completed the original one years ago but then i let the weight get back on due to various reasons). With that set, i’ve gone down from 200 to 188 in just a month. Insanity Deluxe Workout Calendar Month 1 Physical.</p>
