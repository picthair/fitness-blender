<p>Body beast is one of the few programs designed for weight lifting and muscle gains. Greatmats offers some of the best mats and flooring options available to exercise enthusiasts, many of which would be the ideal exercise mat for insanity, aerobics, and many other cardio and strength training workout programs. Insanity is all cardio—i want more weight training. Body beast isn’t made for beginners like 21 day fix, but it doesn’t have to be for fitness experts like p90x3 or insanity max:30, either.
