<p>I have used mct oil myself many times over the years. It is flavorless, making it perfect to add to any meal, shake, salad, or coffee. The best time to take mct oil is about one hour before a workout. That’s 2 tsp of mct oil, or 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of mct creamer. MCT Oil 1200 mg 150 Softgels PipingRock Health Products.</p>
