<p>Wild card workout (optional) try something new! For those of you who enjoy having a plan in place, we’ve created two master rotation calendars of our current ‘walk on’ and ‘walk strong’ series library to help you put them all together into one program! Page 1 of your calendar includes our suggested 4 week schedule, and page 2 includes a key of all the videos included in the. Because they’re accessible to everyone—at every level of fitness—you’ll actually want to stick with the program. Jessica Smith presents Walk Strong 3 Brand new 8 week.</p>
