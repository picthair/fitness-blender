<p>The intensity in insanity and asylum is higher because the workouts are longer and you get tiny breaks to recover. 2, i�d put this slightly closer to hip hop abs than any of the insanity programs. Hence, if you begin focus t25 after insanity the asylum or p90x2, then you will end up burning lesser calories with the workouts because they are usually very short. I am not sure that this is necessarily a con or negative thing though.</p>

<p>In t25 every workout is 25 minutes. This can be a problem for someone who has an exceptionally busy day and has a lot of trouble fitting in an hour workout almost every day. T25 and insanity are definitely more intense so if the intensity is what you are looking for that would be a good choice. With insanity, you can expect to sweat between 40 and 60 minutes most days of the week, and longer on days that include an additional core workout. I got it thinking it would be insanity in 25 minutes, and it�s much closer to shaun t trying to do p90x his way in 25 minutes.</p>
