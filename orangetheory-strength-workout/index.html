<p>Orangetheory focuses on using equipment such as treadmills and rowing machines for cardio exercises, although some strength training is also included. And, everything is supported by heart rate monitors, which measure your progress throughout the workout and share your results on video boards.

<p>What kind of workout is orangetheory fitness? I love dead hangs because they work your upper back, core, forearms, and hand/wrist flexors, but also really help improve grip strength over time.
