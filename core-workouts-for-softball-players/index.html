<p>One good strength core exercise for softball is the abdominal crunch. Start with a kettlebell or dumbbell light enough for proper form but heavy enough to provide a challenge. These “anti” based core principals help softball players and athletes stabilize the hips and spine during athletic movements (such as throwing, sprinting, hitting, jumping). Working your glutes, quadriceps, and core, the goblet squat is an exercise that will increase your range of motion, such an important thing for softball players.
