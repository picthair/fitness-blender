<p>Bret contreras is a fitness trainer and someone who many see as the world’s expert on glute training. The fitness coach celebrates his birthday on the 26th of june and was born in the year 1976.

Three of my favorite glute exercises are the band hip thrust, pendulum quadruped hip extension, and horizontal back extension, but most lifters don’t have access to a hip thruster, a reverse hyper, and a glute ham developer.
