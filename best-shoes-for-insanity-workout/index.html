<p><strong>Best Shoes For Insanity Workout</strong>, Running shoes maybe not the best choice, but not the worst either. For lifting, they would work without any issues. I am sure this is a great running shoe but another shoe that was not built for lateral stability and in my opinion didn’t have as nice of cushioning as the intensity cross trainer. They will offer very little lateral support, but would probably still give enough for p90x.</p>
