<p>I used to take preworkout but find that coffee works just as well, it�s more cost effective and i don�t have to worry about that crazy ingredient listing and proprietary blends. Coffee is a stimulant (we hope you know this), and the caffeine in coffee is natural. If you ever drink coffee on an empty stomach, you know the feeling: If you are going to choose to drink coffee instead of a pre workout product, choose to drink black coffee, coffee which contains only real sugar, or bulletproof coffee.
