<p>Once you’re prepared to do your cardio workout safely, all you need to do is clear a space in your bedroom. Try to bring your elbow close to the opposite knee. Brace your core as you lift your arms and feet off the bed, keeping knees and elbows locked. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds, then relax. aaaannnnnddddd&hellip;&hellip;SLEEP. Easy yoga workouts, Sleep.</p>
