<p>For me, whenever i’m stuck in a training rut or in need of an absolutely killer pump, i always go back to arnold’s chest/back template. Or you can work your pushing muscles — chest, shoulders and triceps — one day, then your pulling muscles — back and biceps — the other day. Personally, i wouldnt work my back and chest on the same day, i really like to hit each one hard, with multiple exercises, and focus for a solid hour on each muscle group, here are my splits, for example. So go for it if u have enough energy to workout both chest and back on the same day, u can do it. Try these on your next chest day!&hellip; Gym tips, Chest.</p>
