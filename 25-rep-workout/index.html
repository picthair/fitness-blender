<p><strong>25 Rep Workout</strong>, Pick a single exercise, preferably a heavy compound lift such as the deadlift, bench press or squat, and complete 25 total repetitions. The 25 repetitions should be divided into. If you do reach failure on the set of 25 reps, your partner can help you finish the set by having you perform the eccentric (lowering portion in the case of the bench press) portion of the lift after you reach concentric failure. On your main lifts, keep the reps low and do enough sets to reach roughly 25 total reps.</p>
