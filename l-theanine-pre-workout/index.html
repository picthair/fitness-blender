<p><strong>L Theanine Pre Workout</strong>, It’s an amino acid that is found primarily in tea leaves, it energizes, calms and motivates you without any of the crashes you can sometimes get with pre workout. This helps to extend focus throughout the day when taking part in earlier workouts. I just got back from the gym. As such, it may be able to counteract some of those nasty side effects to promote a calm, clean, relaxed stimulation like you’ve never experienced before.</p>
