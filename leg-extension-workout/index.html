<p><strong>Leg Extension Workout</strong>, The leg extension is a stalwart isolation exercise that puts all the focus on your quads and it acts as the perfect complement to the leg curl, which isolates the hamstrings. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. While the quads are extending the knee, the weight is resting just on top of the ankle joint. This will be your starting position.</p>

The third reason why leg extensions are a great exercise is that you can minimize compensation away from the quadriceps. Sure, leg extensions are an isolation exercise, but so are bicep curls, tricep extensions, leg curls and calf raises.</p>

<p>Also known as knee extensions, you practice this exercise by extending lower legs and bending knees upwards to lift the required weight set on the machine. A leg extension machine is a workout that targets your quads and strengthens your lower body. The leg extension allows you to accomplish both of these things, and so yes, it certainly will add size to your quads over time. Now, this exercise is very beneficial if done with proper form but beginners should always receive guidance to ensure optimal knee safety during the movement. You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg.</p>
