Your glycogen stores are full and you are most energetic at the beginning of your workout. As long as your cardio is good, you probably don�t need anything stronger than coffee. If you�re aiming for a long cardio session, add some yogurt, an egg, a slice of cheese or a small piece of meat — this protein will help power you through a longer workout.</p>
