<p>Since it is near the end of your fast, your body’s insulin levels have hit their baseline, meaning that your body is no longer storing fat, but rather is burning it. My workouts are almost always first thing in the morning so generally i haven�t eaten any thing. If yo have a morning workout session and you have had your dinner about 3 hours prior to sleeping, you can take it in morning. So by doing some quick maths, if you take pre workout twice in a day, you’re essentially doubling your caffeine intake. Good Morning Abs Workout.</p>
