So if you sync from either garmin connect or strava to trainerroad, then that magic will simply occur automatically, marking it as ‘complete’ on the trainerroad calendar. Trainerroad is an app and online training tool focussed on workouts, results and performance. With outside workouts, you can take any trainerroad workout outside on your wahoo or garmin head unit.
