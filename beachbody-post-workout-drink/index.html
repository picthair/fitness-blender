<p>Beachbody�s p90x recovery drink is now called beachbody recover and has less calories and more protein than ever before. I think it’s just about down the middle of the road. My wife last year decided enough was enough and started a regular exercise routine with t 25. Leucine is the bcaa which helps kickstart muscle protein synthesis. Beachbody E &amp; E give me the extra energy I need to push.</p>
