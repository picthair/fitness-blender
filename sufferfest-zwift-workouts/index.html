<p><strong>Sufferfest Zwift Workouts</strong>, Most cycling workout apps are designed around your ftp (functional power threshold), which is basically the fastest pace / highest wattage that you can maintain during a one hour time trial. What�s wrong with zwift workouts and training plans? Sufferfest offers personalized workouts that are meant to target specific energy systems for each one of their users, all completed on erg mode and without a virtual world. There are several ways this can be done, but you�ll need to ensure that there are no shared connections between the trainer, sensors and the apps.</p>

However, you can make your own custom workouts easily with zwifts drag/drop interface.</p>
