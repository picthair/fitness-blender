<p>In the cutting phase, you will burn excess fat and you will get a ripped and lean body. Use this stack (minus the casein) within 30 minutes before workouts and 30 minutes after workouts (with the casein) and the results will follow. Going through a bulking phase and then a cutting phase is guaranteed to leave you muscled, lean and ripped. In total, bulking and cutting can take between sixteen to thirty two weeks depending on your body type, diet and dedication to your fitness program. Pin on Men�s Health &amp; Fitness.</p>
