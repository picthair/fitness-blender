<p>Your legs are probably pretty fried by this point of your home workout, but try to maintain the jump squat for one minute, rest/pausing if you have to. This perfect leg workout routine is just one example of how training like an athlete means you don’t overlook a single muscle group! Lower your body and the dumbbells toward the floor, maintaining and upright torso, and repeat. This is where you can find all the latest free workouts. Pin on Athlean x.</p>
