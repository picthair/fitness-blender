<p><strong>Beastmaker 2000 Workout</strong>, Can do repeaters off the biggest hold on 3 back fingers and 3 front and two middle and two front. I am starting off with deadhangs in pocket 6, 7, 8, sloper 2 for for building a foundation of strength to prevent injuries. Lots of strong youths do it the other way round. This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000.</p>

<p>The result is a hangboard which tests the limits of finger strength and will help you towards your high grade goals. 1 set of repeaters consists of hanging for 7 seconds, resting for 3 seconds, and repeating 7 times. Wouldn�t exactly call me a 7c climber. I love the idea of translational strength and the things you can do outside of climbing to improve your climbing performance, and its no secret that finger strength is number 1 when it comes to contributing factors.</p>
