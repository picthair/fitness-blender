<p><strong>God Of War Pre Workout</strong>, While older versions included dmaa, this version contains dmha as juglans regia extract. Consisting of multiple powerhouse ingredients plus additional stimulants, god of war red provides maximum pump, focus, and endurance during any type of training. It is great as an alternative to preworkouts containing strong, banned stimulants, without the sacrifice of losing that amazing punch. God of war is a name of a product not the name of the brand/company :p.</p>
