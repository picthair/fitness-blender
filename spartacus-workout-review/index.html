<p>I personally felt like i was too busy looking at the clock to give all of my attention to the moves (even when i had a buzzer set up to alert me)…the good thing is that i can always fix that in the future by getting a better watch or better yet, working out with a buddy who can call. It�s very hard at least for me to hit that time goal!

<p>The problem with the spartacus workout is that the actors didn�t actually follow that workout. 3 circuits of 10 exercises15 seconds rest between each exercise2 minutes rest between each circuitrepeat 3 days/week It will build your cardiovascular and muscle strength simultaneously. I haven�t lost any strength at all, in fact my 1 rep max on deadlifts and military presses have gone up 10%. The Spartacus Workout Printable upperbodyworkoutchart.</p>
