<p>Our goal is to keep you safe and give you the time, tools and techniques to perform a rescue. The surface rescue swimmer program consists of a cadre of civilian mariners who are trained to evaluate the condition of survivors in the water and provide immediate assistance to ensure their successful recovery. Blame the sand because it did not make you quick on the course. The program, created by air force special operations command, is divided into two phases (11 and 15 weeks). Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Pay, School, Training, and More.</p>
