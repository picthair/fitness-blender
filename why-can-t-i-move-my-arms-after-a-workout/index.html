<p>Hold for as long as you can—up to two minutes. When i first started the gym i would be very stiff and sore for at least a week, restricting my normal range of movement. Back started hurting right after the workout, got home, slept, woke up, stretched and couldn�t move at all. Whenever i apply weight and force my arm flat, it causes pain and discomfort.
