<p>Eason has created several workout routines that are followed by millions. I completed three sets of 12 repetitions of six different exercises and have a feeling i’m going to be really sore tomorrow. You’ve been lacing up your sneakers and heading to the gym at least 5 days a week, yet you’re frustrated…. When i’ve strength trained on my own in the past, i usually did three sets of 15 repetitions, but lowering the reps to 12 and grabbing heavier weights added a whole new challenge.
