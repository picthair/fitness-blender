<p><strong>Can I Workout After Getting My Eyebrows Microbladed</strong>, If you must exercise then please, please, please make. When can i exercise after microblading? The healing process mostly lasts 7 days, but it is recommended to wait for at least 10 days (source of information?) before the first workout, just to be on the safe side. You can exercise to your heart�s content but only once your brows are completely healed (meaning you don�t have any scabs or open wounds).</p>
