<p>Home workouts as i am a complete newcomer when it comes to this sort of thing, i was wondering if anyone could give me a home routine designed to work on chest/abs/arms without the use of equipment (it would be very much appreciated) This was conventional deadlifts in the original routine, but the problem with doing a conventional deadlift with dumbbells is that it turns into more of a squat/deadlift hybrid exercise due to the line of pull, so my preference is to do dumbbell romanian deadlifts instead to keep. This allows for high workout frequency and a full body split workout while still allowing each muscle group adequate recovery time.
