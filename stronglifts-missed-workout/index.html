<p><strong>Stronglifts Missed Workout</strong>, Start with this training program if you’ve never lifted weights before, never did the main exercises, or haven’t lifted weights in a long time. * don�t use bigger increments than 5lb/workout or you�ll miss reps and plateau early on * once you deadlift 220lb, switch from 10lb to 5lb increments each workout for longer progress * if you miss reps, repeat the weight next workout. With stronglifts, the trainee performs just five multijoint barbell lifts per week: These sessions are just for gradually ramping up the weight while working on technique.</p>
