<p><strong>Ecto Mesomorph Workout</strong>, Don�t worry — your body type is naturally suited to perform wonderfully in endurance activities. Although i have the mesomorph’s capacity to gain muscle and be athletic, my body’s natural tendency is toward thinness. You can be a meso, ecto, or endo of any dress size. Give yourself more time for rest and recovery by never training for more than two days without a break.</p>

Hanging leg raises (knee raises if you dont have the core strength), decline situps with weight (above the head), leg raises with a plate on the shins, and i prefer reverse crunches to regular crunches.</p>
