<p>Essentially zumba on steroids, insanity fuses callisthenics (bodyweight exercises) with martial arts and plyometric work (jump variations) to make. Shaun t is a very motivational speaker, but doesn’t make the users understand why exactly they are doing the particular workout. And the strictly bodyweight thing is really awesome too. I really, really love this workout and i keep doing it even though i don�t do the other insanity workouts. P90X Bring it P90x workout, Insanity workout, Workout.</p>
