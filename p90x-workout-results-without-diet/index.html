<p><strong>P90x Workout Results Without Diet</strong>, The limited carbohydrate intake may help with burning fat, but because carbs are your body�s preferred fuel source, you may lack energy for the workouts. If you are not prepared for the workout at any of the phases, consider changing the phase and getting your body properly fueled so you can do the p90x workout. The p90x workout utilizes a tremendously high training frequency, intensity, and volume. If you dedicate yourself to the diet and workouts of the p90x exercise program, you will burn belly fat, lose love handles, and build lean muscle mass.</p>

<p>This is because your diet is an essential part of any exercise program, p90x included. Like any other exercise program or a serious muscle building routine, nothing works correctly without a proper diet plan. The p90x workout utilizes a tremendously high training frequency, intensity, and volume. Following the p90x classic schedule which has three weight training, one calisthenic, one kickboxing and one yoga workout during the first week, you would burn approximately 2,666 calories. No workout program can overcome a poor diet plan, so without both factors being considered, results will be slim to none.</p>
