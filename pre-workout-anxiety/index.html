<p><strong>Pre Workout Anxiety</strong>, I’ve been taking pre workout for 4 years now almost every single day. I would go with a simple cup of coffee pre workout and add a non stim product such as vasomax or high volume. If i have a pre workout that contains yohimbine, on an empty stomach, i get very anxious. Don’t take pre workout just don’t take it especially if you already have anxiety.</p>
