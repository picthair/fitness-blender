<p>I�m pretty aware of flexing my chest when i come up and to really squeeze my chest. It�s more like at the bottom of my stretch, i can feel my rear delt fully flex. The wrong way could cause injury and is often not as productive. It is sharp and sudden. Pin by savmax on Упражнение Soreness, Movie posters, Chest.</p>
