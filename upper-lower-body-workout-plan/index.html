A hypertrophy program — such as this upper lower split program — is designed not to increase strength or improve athletic performance (although there is an overlap, of course), but to primarily cause muscular growth by increasing the size of your muscle fibers. So, week 1 will have two upper body days and one lower body day, and week 2 will have two lower body days and one upper body day, and it will continue like this for the duration of the plan. For beginers and intermediates, it might be worth holding off on this program until you feel you’ve built the prerequisite muscular endurance to perform all sets with perfect form.
