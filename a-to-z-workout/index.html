The workout tones the body by using repetitive, resistance exercises which work in a way similar to interval training due to the varying speeds at which the routines are performed. 3) design a daily routine with variety, flexibility and fun. The more you do this exercise, the more easily the uplifting power words start coming to you. This makes it a fun and uncomplicated way to learn quite difficult dance moves and means you need relatively little dance skill to get into zumba.</p>
