<p>The term âthresholdâ is generally synonymous with other common exercise physiology terms like lactate threshold (lt), anaerobic threshold (at), and maximal lactate steady state (mlss) [1]. â¢ donât do lt training all year. If you are a relatively new athlete that has not yet reached your metabolic limits, you can use threshold workouts to move lactate threshold to a greater percentage of vo2 max; Think of this as your speed spectrum, with lactate threshold as one limit. The cycling workouts that are effective for improving aerobic endurance have to be challenging enough that they stress your aerobic system, but not so strenuous that you are approaching lactate threshold.</p>
