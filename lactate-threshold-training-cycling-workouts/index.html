<p><strong>Lactate Threshold Training Cycling Workouts</strong>, This is why the popularised “lactate threshold” workouts like the ubiquitous 2x20 minutes prescription are typically used. Your ftp is an estimate of the highest amount of power you can sustain for sixty minutes. 3 x 10 minute ftp intervals. At this limit, if you are conditioned, you have some 60 to 90 minutes of top threshold speed.</p>

<p>You can go faster for longer periods. As a cyclist, it is the highest level of intense cycling that you can handle for 60 minutes. The cycling workouts that are effective for improving aerobic endurance have to be challenging enough that they stress your aerobic system, but not so strenuous that you are approaching lactate threshold. Training lactate threshold with sweet spot training.</p>

<p>Start with a 10 minute warm up at your endurance zone with some 1 minute fast cadence efforts (above 110rpm). You can go faster for longer periods. These workouts should only be done during the build phase. For competitive cyclists, the lactate threshold is the main area of developmental focus. This is why the popularised “lactate threshold” workouts like the ubiquitous 2x20 minutes prescription are typically used.</p>

<p>The cycling workouts that are effective for improving aerobic endurance have to be challenging enough that they stress your aerobic system, but not so strenuous that you are approaching lactate threshold. After eight weeks of lactate threshold work (two cycles of three weeks of lt training twice a week, then one week easy, as just described), spend at least a month riding steadily at about 30 beats below lt to build your endurance. The term “threshold” is generally synonymous with other common exercise physiology terms like lactate threshold (lt), anaerobic threshold (at), and maximal lactate steady state (mlss) [1].
