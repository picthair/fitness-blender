<p>This differs from a body part split, which focuses on a few muscle groups per training session. The 4 day sample workout includes an upper day, lower day, and 2 full body days. Or, you can strictly train legs on your squat day, your back on deadlift day, chest on bench day, and shoulders and arms on the pressing day. You get more rest than usual to allow your body more recovery so you can lift the maximum weight possible. Dumbbells Only Workout FullBody Power · WorkoutLabs Fit.</p>
