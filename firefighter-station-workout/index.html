<p><strong>Firefighter Station Workout</strong>, Using an exercise mat, place yourself in a “plank” position. Functional training improves performance, reduces injuries and ultimately, prolongs careers. Using the equipment in place of actual free weights allows you to do similar workouts such as the turkish stand up exercise with the scba instead of a kettle bell. To do so, stretch your arm down sideways through the grounded forearm and rotate your body into a side plank by reaching upward.</p>
