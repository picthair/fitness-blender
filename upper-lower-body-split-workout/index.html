<p>This program involves an upper/lower split, with two upper body and two lower body workouts. The next day you only perform lower body exercises along with a focus on your abs. When doing an upper/lower split you alternate between an upper body workout and lower body workout, meaning each part of the body gets a dedicated training session. Then take a rest day before repeating the process one more time. Pin on Real runners wear neon..</p>
