<p><strong>Should You Do Cryotherapy Before Or After A Workout</strong>, For those who work in extremely hot environments, cryotherapy, whether in a bath or booth, after an extremely strenuous outdoor workout can help lower core temperature, which is an important component of recovery. You may find a session every few days for a few weeks in total is all you need to reduce your healing time, get back in motion and feel fitter faster.

This technique carries few risks and complications, since exposure to cold is brief and is always done in a controlled manner, so that care after a cryotherapy is reduced to specific cases.</p>
