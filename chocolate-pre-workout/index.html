<p>White chocolate is devoid of flavonoids. Here’s a quick and easy chocolate recipe that includes a little known sweetener (zero sugar!) that actually helps with workout recovery. You will get little or no benefit from nibbling milk chocolate before a workout since it’s light on flavonoids and other active compounds and contains milk that can potentially inactive any flavonoids that are present. If you�re really keen on convenience, make a protein shake instead: Cellucor C4 Ripped Pre Workout Powder + Fat Burner, Cherry.</p>
