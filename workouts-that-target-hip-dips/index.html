<p>This exercise targets your glutes, thighs, hip flexors, hamstrings, calves, and those hip dips. Place a medium strength hip resistance band around your legs, at the level of your knees. Be sure to keep your core engaged and your chest up. As stated above, you can never fully get rid of them as they are a part of your bone structure. Pin on Health2.</p>
