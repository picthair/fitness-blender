Raisins, for example, are one of the most alkaline things we can put into our bodies, which helps return our ph to the desired basic range, as it tends to become acidic during long bouts of training. Our goal is to take advantage of the metabolic window and get amino acids and sugar into our muscles at a time in which the body craves them the most. They do this by both providing adequate protein for resynthesis of muscle (after breakdown during workout) and replenishing glycogen (stored sugar that was used during the workout). 11 Quick + Healthy PostWorkout Snacks Paleo, Healthy, Easy.</p>
