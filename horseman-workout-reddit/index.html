<p>Subreddit for the netflix animated series, bojack horseman, starring bojack horseman as bojack horseman. The basic layout is 4 days a week. The many capillary vessels allow a good supply to the horse’s muscle fibres and heart ( supply’s glucose and fatty acids) as well as the efficient removal of carbon dioxide and lactate. Video for the program here. Screenshot from the new season of BoJack Horseman.</p>
