<p><strong>Protein After Ab Workout</strong>, The thing is that if you eat animal products (that you call protein), you will always be packing extra fat, since all animal products are rich in fat, saturated fat. It’s an absolutely proven falsehood that you need to consume your whey protein within 30 minutes after your workout to maximize bioavailability and muscle uptake. When you are taking in enough protein after workout, your muscle tissues come back stronger and denser. Most traditional sports drinks do not contain protein, but there are some that do, and interestingly many that do have added protein that is isolated from milk.</p>

But science says it all depends on how intense your workout is, and not your body size. It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training.</p>

<p>After a workout your body will need 10 grams of essential amino acids in one sitting to maximize your muscle building and repair, and it needs to be taken with carbs (about 1.5 g x your weight in kg) within 30 minutes after completing your workout. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass. When you consume protein, your body uses that to build and repair tissues, so it becomes not only important for muscle recovery but much more. Protein intake is a vital part of any diet, but when working out its importance increases. Adding protein prior to your training session primes the pump:</p>

But science says it all depends on how intense your workout is, and not your body size. When you are taking in enough protein after workout, your muscle tissues come back stronger and denser. It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training.
