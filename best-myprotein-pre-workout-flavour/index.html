<p>This pre workout mix is fabulous! It gives me a boost, which is the best way to describe it, literally all day. They mix well and are easily some of the best flavours to have with water. The blue raspberry flavour mypre is what we’ve been trialling and it has not disappointed. Buy Nutrigain Accelerate PreWorkout Powder Lemon.</p>

<p>Definitely for more of a sweet tooth but had some slight sourness to balance it out. Finishing in first place as the best myprotein flavour as voted by hgr is the classic banana flavour. For me, the best one is the chocolate mint, but the chocolate brownie is also very good, with a much richer flavour than the standard chocolate smooth. If you like a stronger taste, the dark chocolate is also very good, but i’d avoid the dark chocolate and salted caramel and the dark chocolate and chilli.
