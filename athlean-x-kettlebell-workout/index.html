<p><strong>Athlean X Kettlebell Workout</strong>, This program is accessible to all skill levels thanks to three intensity levels, hits all fitness areas adequately (including power and agility), is unique, and prioritizes compound lifts. The app lets you choose which body part you want to train and who long you’d like your workout session to be. My first exposure to him happened about three or four years ago seeing his ads and videos on youtube. When i talked to john meadows, he said, “watch what jeff does at athlean x.” meadows himself said, a lot of people hate on the guy but he is a really good dude.</p>
