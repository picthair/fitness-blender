<p><strong>Chalk Workout Program</strong>, Chalk online workouts are programmed once per week, allowing access to 5 brand new workouts to choose from every single day. We work closely with our members to create and implement personal training programs and health strategies tailored to their goals. To perform as well as possible on maximum effort attempts, using chalk is crucial for lifts like the bench, squat, deadlift, snatch, and clean &amp; jerk. Chalk provides a single system to ensure that your curriculum, instruction, and assessment are integrated with one another and tied back to the relevant standards.</p>
