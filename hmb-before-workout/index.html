<p><strong>Hmb Before Workout</strong>, I�ve also tried mildronate before workouts. Studies suggest that it is best to take hmb before exercise or high intensity training.

The recommended dose of hmb is about 3 grams at least one hour before an intense workout. This means that you body stays in an anabolic state for longer allowing for more muscle growth.</p>
