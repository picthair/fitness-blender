<p>Since i�m writing, and i love to write, i�ll also write about my emotions in this journey b/c a lot of this will be emotional. So day 11 is the cardio recovery. Yes, it is a recovery day for your lungs, but it isn�t for your leg muscles. This way i will then increase my calories to not fall below the the 2lb a week ratio. But i still can�t hold the squat and the lunge for the time they do on the dvd, its just to hard and painful to hold it that long.</p>
