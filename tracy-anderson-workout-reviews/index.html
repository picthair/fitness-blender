<p><strong>Tracy Anderson Workout Reviews</strong>, My journey with tracy anderson began with a dislocated ankle and a broken leg. The name metamorphosis scares me a little 😛 but i love the idea that you can lose weight where you need to lose and not everywhere. But, i worked up a sweat with the 1st disc and did feel a bit of soreness afterwards. I also did her post pregnancy video during that time and lost 9 inches around my waist.</p>
