<p>Stand up with your feet wider than your hips and your toes slightly turned out as you sit back into a squat. That means you’ll want a shed style with a steeper roof pitch to give you all the overhead space you’ll need. You’ll feel more motivated and ready for a workout in a space that’s bright and inviting. No matter what style of shed you choose, we recommend adding a few extra windows for natural light. West Vancouver Workout Shed Backyard gym.</p>
