<p>Shoutout to my supp sponsor myprotein: Since each workout plan can be divided into upper body and lower body exercises you will want to use a different routine for each type of calisthenics training. Make sure that you set up your chest tall and hold the shoulders blade back. Do not make the mistake that you only focus on your upper body. A calisthenics workout is the best kind of exercise because it uses your bodyweight to build strength and muscle, which means you don’t need much equipment to push yourself to the limit.</p>
