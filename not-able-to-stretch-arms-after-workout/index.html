Having sore, stiff arms from muscle exhaustion will often occur the day after a heavy weights session. I am having this issue too, but i am on day three of not being able to fully extend my arms. This is why it is so important to stretch completely after every type of workout whether it be running or kickboxing. Stretches for legs Exercise, Excercise, Stretching exercises.</p>
