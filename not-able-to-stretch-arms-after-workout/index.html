<p>Stand on the ground in a relaxed position, with feet close to each other and hands relaxed. Save yourself at 10 minutes after each workout for stretching. Drop your head downwards (take your chin toward your chest) and pause for 5 seconds. Your injured arm should be resting on your body, with your elbow bent at 90 degrees. Stretch full body Archery, Upper body stretches.</p>
