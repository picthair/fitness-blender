<p>The only modification to your normal workout is to go easy on heavy squats. Set the dumbbells in front of your feet on the floor. You won�t be at maximum strength on either of the lifts, and it all depends on your form, your program, and your fitness goals and objectives. You can include both deadlifts and squats in the same workout, or you can perform them on alternating days. Can You Squat and Deadlift In The Same Workout.</p>
