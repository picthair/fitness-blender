<p>The main thing you should be looking at is if your triceps and shoulders are getting enough rest because as you probably well know, when training chest you use your triceps alot and put your shoulders under pressure. This program is designed to increase chest strength and size. In concrete terms, if you perform a chest session, you will need to wait between 2 to 3 days before working the same muscle group again. To get optimal gains in maximum strength, the body needs a complete recovery, so 48 to 72 hours. Chest day is here again! Chest workout for mass, Chest.</p>

<p>How long to rest between workouts depends on how much time your body needs to recover, which depends on many factors (more on that later). My general rule of thumb when resting between workouts is 48 hours for small muscles such as biceps, triceps, calves. Another approach would be to take a rest day after working the chest on two consecutive days. In this workout program you will have 2 days of upper body exercises and 2 days of lower body exercises weekly. (Swipe Left) Complete 6 days a week superset workout plan.</p>
