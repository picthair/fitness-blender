<p>Living a healthy lifestyle helps me care for my family better and to feel strong and confident within myself! Wells has now created a selection of workout programmes to help women empower themselves through fitness. This review covers my thoughts on another sweat app (or bbg) program called pwr at home by kelsey wells and this time i found better results! Those following pwr will use large equipment and machines, free weights, resistance and bodyweight exercises to pursue their fitness goals.

<p>Resistance training makes up the core of bbg. While i did see tons of progress by reducing some stubborn fat, i couldn’t shake the fear of muscle atrophy. Kelsey wells is an instagram star and fitness trainer with over 2 million followers. Each resistance workout within the program is 28 minutes in length. Pin on Fitness.</p>
