<p>Stick one of your object balls somewhere near the foot spot, but not on it (the foot spot is the place where the head ball goes in the rack for breaking). Pool workouts give you a great total body workout which will make your transition back to the court an easier one. A hydroworx exercise pool can also provide a supplemental training routine while you recover from injury or a muscle strain.
