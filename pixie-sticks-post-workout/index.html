Some people do drink a glass of fruit juice in order to spike their carbs but there are other reasons that you might want to drink fresh juice and not just fruit juice.some people even go so far as to eating candies after they workout (a popular one are the classic pixie sticks since they contain dextrose which is the most popular form of post workout sugar).
