<p><strong>Itching After Pre Workout</strong>, So it makes sense that supplement companies put them into their formulas. You could experience itchiness anywhere on your body but it is commonly reported in the face, neck and back of hands. Intense exercise can also cause clogging of your sweat glands, resulting in an itchy heat rash. This will help, especially if you have an allergy or intolerance towards certain ingredients used in supplements.</p>
